AvMobile - Avtomalinovka just got better
========================================

An application I developed for myself when was in need of buying a new car.
I'm always exacting to the tools that I use. If I do not like it - I make it better!
http://av.by was not looking good in my iPhone and was missing some functionality that I needed, so I decided to develop an app that will suite all my needs.

Here what it does:

1. Scrapes http://av.by for blurbs :)
2. Looks good in iPhone!!!
3. Delivers SMS to cellphone when new blurb matching filter criteria imported.
4. Has minimum Ads and allows to turn them off.
5. User friendly.

Why did I make it opensource?
-----------------------------

I'm not a person that knows how to sell. I'm a developer with a passion to what I do!

It's simply too expensive to pay for Terabytes of images on Amazon, and couple of instances on Heroku. Two Google Ads placeholders makes no revenue compared to expenses :)
